# Mathison — Project State

> Read this at the start of every session.

## Current State

- **Phase**: Post-MVP — all 11 build steps complete, E2E tested
- **App directory**: workspace root (not inside `mathison/`)
- **Dev server**: `yarn dev` on port 3000
- **Worker**: `yarn worker` in separate terminal (needed for deployments)
- **Docker services**: postgres on 5433, redis on 6379 (`docker compose -f docker-compose.local.yml up -d`)
- **K8s cluster**: kind `mathison-dev` (K8s v1.35.0)
- **Database**: migrated + seeded — 5 published recipes, pgvector active (v0.8.1)
- **Test user**: admin@mathison.dev / admin1234 (workspace: mathison-dev)

## Environment

| Tool | Version / Path | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Node.js | v22.22.0 | yarn 1.22.22 |
| Next.js | 16.1.6 | App Router, Turbopack dev |
| Prisma | 7.4.0 | adapter-pg pattern |
| PostgreSQL | 16 (Docker) | port **5433** |
| Redis | 7 (Docker) | port 6379 |
| Helm | v4.1.1 | `/opt/homebrew/bin/helm`, bitnami repo |
| kubectl | system | `/usr/local/bin/kubectl` |
| kind | system | `/opt/homebrew/bin/kind` |
| LLM | Anthropic | API key in .env.local |

## Known Issues

- Turbopack root warning about multiple lockfiles — mitigated with `turbopack.root: "."` in next.config.ts
- Port 5432 occupied by `aucm` project — using 5433
- Next.js 16 deprecation: "middleware" convention deprecated in favor of "proxy" — middleware still works

## Decisions Log

Architectural decisions that affect all future work. Reference by ID when relevant.

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| D1 | LLM provider: Anthropic (Claude) | User preference |
| D2 | K8s testing: local `kind` cluster | Disposable, automatable, no shared infra risk |
| D5 | Package manager: yarn | User preference |
| D6 | Prisma 7 with adapter pattern | Latest Prisma; `prisma-client` generator, `@prisma/adapter-pg` |
| D7 | Prisma client output: `src/generated/prisma` | Import from `@/generated/prisma/client` |
| D8 | Postgres port: 5433 | Avoid conflict with existing postgres on 5432 |
| D9 | App at workspace root (not `mathison/`) | Clean layout, single package.json |
| D10 | pgvector 0.8.1, 1536-dim embeddings | Matches text-embedding-3-small output |
| D12 | Split auth config (Edge + full) | Middleware runs in Edge, can't import Prisma |
| D13 | JWT only, no Prisma adapter | Custom user fields, credentials-only auth |
| D14 | bcryptjs (pure JS), 12 salt rounds | No native addon issues |
| D15 | Catalog API routes are public | Write ops check auth in handler |
| D18 | AI SDK v6 API (`inputSchema`, `toUIMessageStreamResponse`, etc.) | Breaking changes from v5 |
| D30 | child_process.execFile for Helm (not execa) | execa v9 ESM-only breaks tsx worker |
| D42 | Cloud-first rebrand: hide K8s terminology from UI | Users see "services" not "Helm charts" |
| D43 | AI SDK v6 UIMessage format | `convertToModelMessages` on server, parts-based rendering on client |
| D56 | Worker bootstrap pattern (index.ts → dynamic import main.ts) | Static imports hoist above dotenv.config() |
| D57 | Bitnami chart versions = NULL (use latest) | Pinned versions reference removed Docker Hub tags |

## Consumer Pivot — Steps 12–20

Target audience shift: from infrastructure engineers to **non-technical consumers** who want to run open-source apps without any technical knowledge. Plan created 2026-02-15.

| Step | Name | Status | Summary |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| 12 | App Data Model | **done** | Enriched Recipe with consumer fields: shortDescription, useCases, gettingStarted, screenshots, websiteUrl, documentationUrl, installCount, featured. All 5 seed recipes enriched. Install count incremented on deploy. |
| 13 | App Store UI | pending | Redesign catalog into visual App Store as the homepage. Featured apps, categories, rich cards. |
| 14 | One-Click Install | pending | Install button on app cards — no chat required. Confirmation dialog, progress indicator, success screen. |
| 15 | My Apps Dashboard | pending | Replace canvas/deployments with consumer-friendly "My Apps" grid. Status indicators, open buttons, settings. |
| 16 | Consumer Agent | pending | Rewrite system prompt + tools for non-technical users. Recommend by problem, diagnose in plain English. |
| 17 | Onboarding | pending | Streamlined signup, welcome flow with category picker, first-install celebration. |
| 18 | App Access & URLs | pending | Auto port-forward for kind, clean URLs, "Open App" button, connection info for databases. |
| 19 | Expanded Catalog | pending | Grow from 5 to 20+ apps. Activepieces, Plane, Outline, Gitea, Nextcloud, Immich, Metabase, Grafana, Vaultwarden, etc. |
| 20 | Consumer Polish | pending | Visual consistency, loading states, error handling, mobile responsiveness, accessibility, language audit. |

## Feature Log

Track new features built after MVP. Add entries as you go.

| Date | Feature | Files Changed | Notes |
|------|---------|---------------|-------|
| 2026-02-13 | Multi-workspace support | ~20 files | New Workspace model, workspace CRUD API, sidebar selector, settings management, deployment engine workspace-scoped, AI agent workspace tools. Namespace format: `{tenantSlug}-{workspaceSlug}`. Active workspace via cookie + DB. Migration auto-created default workspaces for existing tenants. |
| 2026-02-17 | Step 12: App Data Model | 7 files | Added 8 consumer-facing fields to Recipe (shortDescription, useCases, gettingStarted, screenshots, websiteUrl, documentationUrl, installCount, featured). Enriched all 5 seed recipes with taglines, use cases, getting-started guides, and website URLs. Added `incrementInstallCount()` in catalog service, called from deployment engine. Migration, types, service, seed script all updated. |
